# MapUp - Analytics Dashboard Assessment

## Overview

The objective of this assessment is to analyze the provided Electric Vehicle (EV) population data and create a frontend dashboard that visualizes key insights about the dataset. This repository contains the necessary data and instructions for you to demonstrate your analytical and dashboard creation skills. Feel free to use any tech stack you want to create the dashboard.

## Dataset

The Electric Vehicle Population dataset is available in the [Electric Vehicle Population Data (CSV)](./data-to-visualize/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv) within this repository, for more information about the dataset visit [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/electric-vehicle-population).

**Note:** We've reduced the dataset in the repository to keep the data size small in the frontend bundle.

## Tasks

### Dashboard Creation:

- Create a frontend dashboard that presents key insights from the dataset.
- Design the dashboard to effectively communicate important metrics and visualizations.
- Include visual representations such as charts, graphs, or tables to showcase trends and relationships in the data.

### Deployment:

- Deploy your frontend dashboard to a hosting platform of your choice.
- Make sure the dashboard is publicly accessible.
